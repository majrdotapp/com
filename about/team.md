## Founding Team 

**Jamie Cannon**, CEO, Founder

Jamie Cannon brings 15+ years of product management experience at Microsoft, where he held leadership positions launching enterprise software and later consumer hardware. In addition to working directly with Bill Gates on Microsoft’s early open-source strategy, Jamie has also worked at startups such as Twitter and Doppler Labs. His background in computer science combined with over two decades of corporate experience gives him unique insight into both the technical as well as the business of product making, as well as a thorough understanding of how to scale a business from its first version to international success. 

After leaving Microsoft in 2018, Jamie’s time spent traveling the world led him to the insight that catalyzed majr’s creation: the growth-fixated tech industry is fostering a global monoculture, pushing the same media, music, and culture onto the same devices in every corner of the world. If we want a thriving culture, we need a diverse culture, and current modes of distribution are actively curtailing diversity.

In service to this ideal, Jamie serves as Vice President of the Board at Harlem Stage, an organization dedicated to funding artists of color. Jamie also has a personal commitment to creating a positive company culture, and believes that more democratic and compassionate workplaces make for higher quality products and happier people.
