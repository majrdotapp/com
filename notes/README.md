# majr Blogs and Announcements

### **What's majr?**
majr is better way for creators and fans to connect around what matters most - creativity. We started majr because we believe the the strongest communities are the ones with the most diverse and vibrant ideas. We build everything with that mission in mind.
<BR>
### **Why are we using github for business and marketing docs?**  
While our primary focus is on building products and services, we think we can do more.  
  
One of the ways we can do more is by sharing how we approach building and operating this company. Here you will find many of our frameworks, operational models and marketing docs. You will find things that have worked - and things that have not. 

By using GitHub, you can track changes, understand context and fork what might work for you. 
<BR><BR>
**What will live on GitHub?**  
You'll find everything non-product maintained here, just like any other code repository. For example:<BR>
- [Investor Updates](https://github.com/majr-tech/com/tree/main/investor/01-Updates)
- About us & Team 
- Terms of Use & Privacy Policy
- Blogs
- Test Template & Results


We'll be using channels like Twitter as notification mediums for updates and announcements, with source maintained on GitHub. 

There are two exceptions.
The first exception is product education. That said, product edu will be built into the product vs. being maintained in a seperate hosting environment. <BR>
The second is any sensitive financial, customer and sales data, financial data and human resources. This makes obvious sense, but we strive to be maximally open.
