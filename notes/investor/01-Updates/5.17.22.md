# May '22 Investor Update 
Last week concluded a strong 3 month sprint since [launching our beta](https://www.majr.tech/post/majr-loves-artists "https://www.majr.tech/post/majr-loves-artists") on Feb 14th.  We've continued to see customer excitement around the product, even in rough form. We released a [second update](https://www.majr.tech/post/announcing-majr-milestone-2 "https://www.majr.tech/post/announcing-majr-milestone-2") while continuing to test a number of concepts, the most promising being a fan experience built on the data exhaust of the artist tooling. Songwriting and lyric editing also continues to elicit very positive responses. 

At the moment, we aren't charging for our beta. As we get closer to open beta, we are considering Believer-type accounts for one-time payments of ~$150.   Later this summer we intend on turning on revenue for premium subs. We will need to be careful about timing as we don't have the capacity to onboard more customers while we continue rapidly iterating on the product. 

While revenue is the most important metric for the health of the company, we continue to tightly manage expenses in this environment. 

**Additional**
- This week we officially closed customer #1 via a jointly executed market development agreement which will see the first fan experience + promotion in July  
- We have enough cash to comfortably get us through open beta and into our round. While we close friends & family, we've begun reaching out to prospective investors around our work  
- I will be in NYC and LA doing an artist tour and attending industry events once our open beta is live 
- We're on track for a public launch by end of the year 

**Key Metrics**
- Monthly Burn: $17k* 
- Cash: $91k 
- *7k of the Q1 burn is from legal expenses related to founder agreements and board documentation and will not repeat. 

**How You Can Help**  
- Hiring: [Software Engineer](https://www.majr.tech/career-posts/software-engineer-fullstack "https://www.majr.tech/career-posts/software-engineer-fullstack"), [Marketing Associate](https://www.majr.tech/career-posts/associate-marketing-manager "https://www.majr.tech/career-posts/associate-marketing-manager") and [product management](https://www.majr.tech/career-posts/product-manager "https://www.majr.tech/career-posts/product-manager"). We would consider co-founder equity and title for the product role if they're a strong candidate with consumer experience. 
- Customers:  We actively co-engineer with artists that represent our target market. Any touring indie artists with growing fan communities on Discord, Instagram or Twitter we're expanding our Insider program. 
- Advisor: Anyone you know who has career experience in entertainment law with a focus on music copyright.  We know we will encounter challenges here and are preparing for the legal architecting needed to manage complexity.  

**Next month**
In June, we're going to open [our beta](http://www.majr.app/ "http://www.majr.app/"). We're aiming for general availability by the end of the year, so we're engaging with a design firm and PR firm to get us prepared. 

Thanks for your support. Let me know if you have any questions or feedback.
