**October Editorial**

"[Moving stones around is one thing. This is totally different](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3-CpzZJl8w "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3-CpzZJl8w")..."

We ask ourselves: how do we survive this environment? It's not about how we shrink from our ambitions, but how we grow and do more with less. Do or do not, there is no try.Â 

We've kicked off our active raise.Â We hope to wrap by mid-Nov so we can get back to work. If you or your network invests in new media / creator economy, reach out and I'll share materials.

**September Recap**\
In September we completed our MVP development cycle, delivering fan apps onÂ [web](https://majr.app/harry-styles "https://majr.app/harry-styles")Â and iOS. Â We started outbound marketing, running quick tests of social content strategies, influencer engagement and product-led growth. Â Average CAC of $12.50 to-date.

We continuedÂ investorÂ outreach ahead of our raise. I've been happy with the response so far. Thank you to everyone for engaging and helping to sharpen our pitch.

Go-forward my priority is to close the round. Meanwhile, the team is focused on scaling up marketing, executing our iOS test and beginning to source feature artists as launch partners. Â Â 

**Featured Test**\
In September, we tested two Song Stories:Â [Who Knew](https://majr.app/moontower/who-knew "https://majr.app/moontower/who-knew")? andÂ [Poolside](https://majr.app/moontower/poolside "https://majr.app/moontower/poolside")Â with superfans. Â Headline is we achieved a 27.5% conversation rate with zero marketing spend. Details below:<BR>
  
  | Title | Song Story Conversion Test |
|----------------|--------------|
| **Hypothesis**       | Breaking & professional artists have a commanding relationship with their core fan community. If artists publish useful content to their fans, it will drive meaningful user acquisition.         |
| **Test**     | Provide Moontower fans with a short Song Story about Who Knew? on Friday afternoon (lower level of traffic overall)  and keep the Song Story basic (to focus on the concept) |
| **Audience**           | Moontower general fans:Â  15K<BR>Moontower Superfans: 800 or 5% of base            |
| **Measure**           | Conversion from social to majr (CTR)              |
| **Result**           |      27.5% Conversion from web       |
| **Learning**           |  Artist are an efficient supply-side lever to driving fan acquisition. When the artist endorses, the content bar is low.|
