###### **[Latest Pitch](https://docsend.com/view/jnwm8riu4grhi8zv)**  |  [iOS Concept App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/majr/id1634121602)   |   [Last Month's Update](https://github.com/majr-tech/com/blob/5882e15b8d6fb30c709b3fceb45912c9396f1b04/investor/01-Updates/10-12-22.md)

>Tldr; This update focuses on test results from our recently launched iOS concept app. To-date, we're landing ~25% conversion and ~11% acquisition in artist-led promo with no hard marketing costs. We infer these are high-quality customers. 
  
#### October Summary  
  On Oct 14th we launched a concept app on iOS featuring a song called State of Mind. We've run 2 tests. The first was focused on measuring the effectiveness of acquiring customers through direct artist promo. The second was focused on measuring the effectiveness of acquiring through merchandising at live events in Colorado Springs, St Louis and Tempe, AZ. A custom-branded QR code was promoted at each event (Merch pics below.) Test details available upon request.
  
#### Test Results  
  - Test #1 yielded 10% acquisition rate off n=750, or 77 net new devices. In this test, the artist promoted majr directly to fans within their Discord community. majr incurred no hard marketing costs.
  - Test #2 yielded an avg conversation rate of 25% and acquisition ranging from 5-18%. majr incurred no hard marketing costs. Interesting data: In US Q2 there were 2.8M QR scans with less than 1% driving app installs.
  - Some reasons we lost customers: (i) Android IB in certain geos (ii) Older users didn't scan QR code (iii) challenges installing over cellular.
  
  #### Additional Performance Data
  - Avg 11 Sessions/Active Device, with no product edu or engagement nudges   
  - 18% of session length >  2 minutes
  - Overall Nov MAD: 135 
  
  #### What's next?
  - In Nov we'll scale up testing with an artist drop to 15K fans on Insta. We're forecasting 1k - 1.5k first time downloads. 
  - We'll also be shipping improved desktop views to [artist tools](https://artists.majr.app) 
  - Begin pitching top artists
