**[Latest Pitch](https://docsend.com/view/3mky6bakepq27ukt "https://docsend.com/view/3mky6bakepq27ukt")   |   Sept 2022**

>TL;DR ****10 touring artists secured, open beta launched and majr moved to LA ****☀️**

**Editorial**

Constant shitposts and infinite doomscrolling lead one to believe the endtimes are near.  Meanwhile, the structural issues majr addresses continue to intensify, early customer reaction is positive and we remain heads down building. We need much more capacity for outbound marketing and that is being addressed as we head into the Fall. 

**July & Aug Recap**\
July and August were focused on lining up a high-quality, complete MVP supported by an awesome go-to-market this Fall.   We got 3 big things done while VCs flexed their first vacation in 2 years:

1.  Secured 10 rising touring artists committed to the platform at financing 
2.  Launched public beta, positive word of mouth, experimenting with GTM levers
3.  Finalized product plan and schedule for shipping Song Stories 

Thank you to Jen Richards for contributing to our friends and family round. Your investment supports our mission to grow the value of music by building new and innovative ways for artists and creators to share their work with the world.   We are relentless in our pursuit of creative freedom and improved economics for the creators who infuse our culture with shared meaning and inspiration. 

Ps. We moved the company to LA ☀️
