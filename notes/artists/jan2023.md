 Iâ€™ve been meaning to write an update all month and now itâ€™s overdue. 

**You know why we named the company majr? We want every artist to know and believe that they can be successful on their own terms.  Youâ€™re already a major artist and you donâ€™t need anybody else to confirm this, regardless of how big or small your team is.**

**majr is your stage, weâ€™re just building it**. By bringing together arists (yâ€™all) and product makers (us) â€“ weâ€™re going to build something special.

For your engagement in this effort, weâ€™re deeply grateful. Weâ€™re a small company with big ambitions because thereâ€™s nothing more important than art and music. Music reaches everyone in unexpected ways; it connects and reveals to us truths which are otherwise inaccessible.  Whether youâ€™re working in an esoteric jazz form or mainstream pop, thank you for sharing your spirit and energy with the world. 2023 is going to be a big year and weâ€™re fully committed to serving you in the unique ways that majr can.

Tech is an industry in crisis, now well-understood to have serious deficits in its morals. The world of non-stop, continuous, algorithmic programming which triggers and teases leaves us all feeling fatigued and fearful. Disconnected. I believe we have a role to play in elevating beyond this and offering a new kind of experience that bridges music, storytelling and the real-world. Thatâ€™s the **feeling** of what we want to build with you. 

As we get ready to launch, weâ€™ll begin sharing product plans with an invitation to critique and offer feedback. **Artists have to be in the drivers seat** of building the next generation of music experience.  While I recognize everyone is busy with overflowing inboxes, I hope youâ€™ll participate.

In the meantime, we wanted to share a few core beliefs for how and why weâ€™ll serve our artists this year.  Think of them like our 2023 resolutions ðŸ˜Š

- Weâ€™re in **service** â€“ always -  to the stories of artists and their expression
- Weâ€™re motivated to **connect more people** to themselves and each other through the meaning and experience of music
- When people are connected they **come alive**. The world needs more people who **come alive**
- Weâ€™ll do this by building a company **inside out, not outside-in**.  This means staying true to artists and our mission  
- Weâ€™ll build **intentionally** â€“ thoughtfully considering the cultural, social and human impacts of technology.
  

The next update will include a preview of upcoming product features. The lines of communication are always open;  e-mail or text anytime with ideas, critiques or asks for help.

W/ much gratitude,
Jamie
